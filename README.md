## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my github. Here you'll find projects I have/am working on, as well as various repos I've used. I recently ported several repos from my other github account, so feel free to take a look.

I currently have 20 repositories and counting, many of which are privated due to copyright or school restrictions. To request access to these, please contact via linkedIn or the email on my resume.

See some basic information about me below!

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently working on a full stack project fully deployed on AWS, as well as learning japanese and dabbling in game engines (Godot, Unreal for the most part)
- ðŸ‘¯ Currently looking for either a full stack or backend position.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: See my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremiah-knizley/),
